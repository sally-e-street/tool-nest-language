The first report of a crow's nest made of barbed wire dates back to 1933, and recent (news) reports document the use of e.g. nails, screws, and drug users' syringes in avian architecture. Here we report the first well-documented study on nests of carrion crow Corvus corone and Eurasian magpie Pica pica that almost entirely consist of material that is meant to deter birds: anti-bird spikes. Carrion crows in Rotterdam (The Netherlands) and Eurasian magpies in Enschede (The Netherlands), Antwerp (Belgium), and Glasgow (Scotland) tear entire strips with sharp metal pins off buildings and use them as nesting material. Two anti-bird spike nests, now in the collections of Natural History Museum Rotterdam (crow) and Naturalis Biodiversity Center (magpie), were analyzed for composition and structure. Magpies may use the anti-bird spikes not just as ordinary nest material, but specific placement in the dome, overarching the nest, hints at functional use. The anti-bird spikes may be used by birds in the same way as they were intended to be used by humans: to ward off (other) birds. Crows, for example, are known to prey on magpie eggs and offspring and the specific choice of this sharp material could benefit nest defense, for which magpies may normally rely on thorny branches. Other magpie domes observed were constructed with barbed wire and knitting needles. In the Anthropocene, now that living biomass is outweighed by anthropogenic mass, alternative nesting materials are increasingly being adopted by urban birds. With birds even using bird deterring materials like anti-bird spikes as nesting material, anything may become part of a bird's nest.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0923-9308,,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Biodivers Ctr, Darwinweg 2, Leiden, NL-2333 CR, Netherlands",,,,26/08/2023,ZOOREC:ZOOR15909073650,

One of the species in the Corvidae family nesting in groups is the Rook (Corvus frugilegus). The construction of the nest is costly for birds and needs high energy expenditure. Therefore, birds should optimize the time of nest building in relation to environmental, especially weather, conditions. Furthermore, birds should adapt their breeding phenology, including the date of starting the construction of nests for climate change. We observed the dynamics of increasing numbers of nests in a colony of Rooks in relation to air temperature, wind, rainfall, snowfall and day-length (indirect indicator of photoperiodism). Observations were carried out during three breeding seasons (2015-2017) in a large rookery in a big city in north-eastern Poland. The increase in the number of nests was correlated only with day length and no effect of climatic factors on the number of nests in the colony was observed. Number of nests varied significantly between successive years of research. In the case of the Rook (predictable breeders), the photoperiod seems to be the most important factor influencing breeding behavior, especially nest construction. In the last three decades, increasing temperature and time of spring phases have advanced and have influenced changes in the phenology of the availability of food resources. Simultaneously, a rapid decline in the numbers of breeding pairs of the Rook in Poland has been observed, especially in the last three decades. Conservative attachment to the length of the day, which is the main factor responsible for the development of the breeding colony, makes the Rook appear to be a species with low plasticity in the face of rapid climate changes. Thus, we suggest that may indirectly influence the decrease in the breeding population of the Rook.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,2053-7166,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bialystok, Doctoral Sch Exact & Nat Sci, Ciolkowskiego 1K, Bialystok, PL-15245, Poland",,,,26/06/2022,ZOOREC:ZOOR15807029050,

One striking example is the nests birds build for reproduction, which protect the offspring from external stressors such as predators and temperature, promoting reproductive success. To construct a nest successfully, birds need to make various decisions, for example regarding the nest material and their time budgets. Research has focused mainly on species where one sex is primarily responsible for building the nest. In contrast, the cooperative strategies of monogamous species in which both sexes contribute to nest building are poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of both sexes in nest building and fitness correlates of behaviour in wild, monogamous jackdaw pairs, Corvus monedula. We show that both partners contributed to nest building and behaved similarly, with females and males present in the nestbox for a comparable duration and transporting material to the nest equally often. However, while females spent more time constructing the nest, males tended to invest more time in vigilance, potentially as a means of coping with competition for nest cavities. These findings suggest a moderate degree of division of labour, which may facilitate cooperation. Moreover, some aspects of behaviour were related to proxies of reproductive success (lay date and egg volume). Females that contributed relatively more to bringing material laid earlier clutches and pairs that spent less time together in the nestbox had larger eggs. Thus, selection pressures may act on how nest-building pairs spend their time and cooperatively divide the labour. We conclude that cooperative nest building in birds could be associated with monogamy and obligate biparental care and provides a vital but relatively untapped context through which to study the evolution of cooperation.

However, they typically use species occurrence data rather than robust demographic variables, and their predictive power is rarely evaluated. These shortcomings can result in misleading guidance for conservation. Here, we develop and evaluate a HSM based on correlates of long-term breeding success of an open nest building boreal forest bird, the Siberian jay. In our study site in northern Sweden, nest failure of this permanent resident species is driven mainly by visually hunting corvids that are associated with human settlements. Parents rely on understory nesting cover as protection against these predators. Accordingly, our HSM includes a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based metric of understory density around the nest and the distance of the nest to the closest human settlement to predict breeding success. It reveals that a high understory density 15-80 m around nests is associated with increased breeding success in territories close to settlements (<1.5 km). Farther away from human settlements breeding success is highest at nest sites with a more open understory providing a favorable warmer microclimate. We validated this HSM by comparing the predicted breeding success with landscape-wide census data on Siberian jay occurrence. The correlation between breeding success and occurrence was strong up to 40 km around the study site. However, the HSM appears to overestimate breeding success in regions with a milder climate and therefore higher corvid numbers. Our findings suggest that maintaining patches of small diameter trees may provide a cost-effective way to restore the breeding habitat for Siberian jays up to 1.5 km from human settlements. This distance is expected to increase in the warmer, southern, and coastal range of the Siberian jay where the presence of other corvids is to a lesser extent restricted to settlements.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden",,,,01/05/2020,ZOOREC:ZOOR15605033780,32128152

Avian monogamy is usually defined socially or genetically, whereas quantifications of sexual behavior remain scarce. Jackdaws (Corvus monedula) are considered a rare example of strict monogamy in songbirds, with lifelong pair bonds and little genetic evidence for extrapair (EP) offspring. Yet jackdaw copulations, although accompanied by loud copulation calls, are rarely observed because they occur visually concealed inside nest cavities. Using full-day nest-box video surveillance and on-bird acoustic bio-logging, we directly observed jackdaw sexual behavior and compared it to the corresponding genetic outcome obtained via molecular parentage analysis. In the video-observed nests, we found genetic monogamy but frequently detected forced EP sexual behavior, accompanied by characteristic male copulation calls. We, thus, challenge the long-held notion of strict jackdaw monogamy at the sexual level. Our data suggest that male mate guarding and frequent intrapair copulations during the female fertile phase, as well as the forced nature of the copulations, could explain the absence of EP offspring. Because EP copulation behavior appeared to be costly for both sexes, we suggest that immediate fitness benefits are an unlikely explanation for its prevalence. Instead, sexual conflict and dominance effects could interact to shape the spatiotemporal pattern of EP sexual behavior in this species. Our results call for larger-scale investigations of jackdaw sexual behavior and parentage and highlight the importance of combining social, sexual, and genetic data sets for a more complete understanding of mating systems.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,5,1,5,,,1045-2249,,,,,,,,,,,"Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Neurobiol, Eberhard Gwinner Str, Seewiesen, D-82319, Germany",,,,01/05/2020,ZOOREC:ZOOR15605033511,32372855

When comparing effects at two spatial scales, nest-site and home-range, the effect of the number of undamaged old nests occurred at the home-range scale only, suggesting that these nests are used as an indirect social cue rather than a direct resource cue to reduce the energy or time-consuming costs of nest building. We suggest that undamaged old nests may indicate the presence and breeding performance of conspecifics for several previous years. Because Barn Swallows are migratory birds, undamaged old nests may be a reliable indirect social cue and may reduce the time required to sample information at breeding sites.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,8,0,10,,,0021-8375,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tokyo, Dept Life Sci, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo, 1538902, Japan",,,,30/10/2014,ZOOREC:ZOOR15011062835,

It is revealed that C. splendens prefer light-posts as nesting sites to trees under certain environmental conditions like availability of foods, assurance of nest, nest building materials and eggs and/or young. As there exists, in most cases only one spot for nesting in a light-post and the said spot is usually located at a height ranging from 5.5 to 6.0 m from the ground contrast to an average 11.9 m height of the tree nest. The height of the nest determines the time and energy to be required either for the collection of foods, or to return to the nest within a short time as and when needed in respect to the evolved circumstances. It is apparent that the crows did not care to face the unusual danger to ensure their survival by developing this sort of nesting habit.

In the Orkney Isles, where pole nesting is relatively common, most nests are actively removed before they can cause a fault. However, rebuilding often occurs. Although the electrical company routinely fits Firefly FF-type diverters (P&R Tech Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA) after nest removals to deter the crows from rebuilding, there has been no field test of the effectiveness of the Fireflies as a deterrent. In our study, carried out in Orkney in the Spring/Summer of 2009 and 2010, Fireflies were fitted at half of the sites from which nests were removed and not fitted at the other half of the sites. We found that crows were equally likely to rebuild at sites fitted with Fireflies as they were to rebuild at sites without Fireflies. However, rebuilding was less likely to occur the later in the season that nests were removed, and nests in the middle phase of construction were the most likely to be rebuilt. Therefore, making an appropriate decision as to when to remove a crow nest seems to be a more effective method for deterring nest rebuilding than is the fitting of Firefly diverters.

This includes numbers of ravens at the North Slope Borough's Prudhoe Bay Landfill during winter, and breeding pairs dispersed throughout the oil fields and other human settlements. The oil fields provide abundant anthropogenic resources in terms of food sources and infrastructure for nesting. In this study, we documented nest locations, nest and nest site characteristics, movements of adult and juvenile ravens, and diet of ravens breeding in the North Slope oil fields of Kuparuk and Prudhoe Bay. In addition, we collected data on marked ravens throughout Alaska from the public. We located a total of 89 nests in the oil fields from 2004-2007. From 2004-2006 we monitored nests to determine nest success and productivity and collected data on nest site characteristics. We captured and radio-tagged adult ravens, and marked both adult and juveniles with leg bands and patagial wing tags to estimate home ranges during breeding and document movements. VHF and satellite transmitters failed due to a variety of reasons, therefore data derived from these sources were limited. Ravens placed their nests on oil field infrastructure; 46% were located on processing facilities, 35% on drill sites, and the remaining on other structures including bridges, radar towers, and inactive drill rigs. Nests were built from industrial materials, at an average height of 11 m. In general, nests at Prudhoe were closer to camps, rig activities during nest building, and the landfill than nests at Kuparuk. We found evidence of nest site fidelity; some sites were used in multiple years. Nests at Prudhoe were more productive than Kuparuk in two of the three years; the average number of fledglings produced per breeding pair was 2.0 [plus or minus] 0.4 at Kuparuk and 3.7 [plus or minus] 0.3 at Prudhoe. We found no relationship between nest success or initiation dates with nests placed on heated substrates. Breeding phenology was similar to ravens nesting in other regions of the world. In general, incubation of eggs was initiated from late March until early May. Most nestlings fledged in mid June, corresponding to the time when other tundra-nesting birds initiate their nests. Breeding adults maintained territories ranging on average from 5-10 km2 around nest sites until late in the nestling stage. After chicks fledged, the size of area used around the nest site increased to 4-19 km2 ; however, our estimates were highly variable and sample sizes were small. Adult ravens marked during the breeding season in the oil fields were observed mostly in or near the oil fields during winter, except one seen in Fairbanks. Similarly, ravens marked as juveniles were observed in and near the oil fields (>10 wks after fledging), but were also seen south of the Brooks Range, including Beaver, Fairbanks, and Anchorage. Of juveniles marked in 2004, 18% were seen again their first year, 21% the second year, and 15% the third year. In 2007, 24% of juveniles marked in 2006 were seen again. Numbers of ravens seen at the Prudhoe Bay landfill were lowest during June and July, corresponding to nestling and fledgling stages of breeding. Sub-adults were observed at the landfill more than adults during the breeding season. Raven pellets contained mostly small mammals (55 %) and avian remains (19%). Collared (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) and brown lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus) composed almost half of the small mammals identified in pellet. Alaska's North Slope oil fields provide structures for nesting and anthropogenic food sources that support a resident breeding population of ravens. More research is needed to assess projected population growth and impacts to specific local prey species. Management options for decreasing raven populations include eliminating access to landfills and other food sources, and removing nests.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01/02/2009,ZOOREC:ZOOR14512077393,

Although division of labour among group members has been relatively well studied in insects, less is known about vertebrates. Most studies of avian helping focus solely on the extent to which helpers provision the offspring, however, helpers can participate in everything from nest building to predator defence. Bad provisioners may, for example, not be as 'uncooperative' as they appear. if they are good defenders. Thus, the distribution of helping tasks between group members should have important implications for our interpretation of group dynamics. Here, we compare two distinct forms of helping behaviour in the cooperatively breeding noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala): chick provisioning and mobbing nest predators. We show that the way in which individual helpers invest in these two helping behaviours varies enormously across individuals and among social groups. Good provisioners often contributed relatively little to mobbing and vice versa. Indeed, (18%) of helpers only mobbed, 22% just provisioned, whereas 60% of helpers performed both forms of helping. Across nests, provisioning was significantly negatively correlated with mobbing effort. We suggest that small differences in the costs or benefits of different aspects of helping (due to differences in age, relatedness or social status) have a big impact on the division of labour within a group. Consequently, social groups can be made up from individuals who often specialise in one helping behaviour, and/or helpers who perform a number of behaviours to differing degrees. Division of labour within social groups will, therefore, have important consequences for the maintenance of cooperatively breeding in vertebrates.",,,,,,,,,84,0,0,0,77,0,89,,,0005-7959,,,,,,,,,,,"Division of Environmental and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Graham Kerr Building, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, United Kingdom",,,,01/11/2005,ZOOREC:ZOOR14205027071,

So, I investigated the nesting materials in Central Osaka City and eastern Sakai City from February 2002 to March 2003. I studied the relation between the nests in which wire hangers were used and the proportion of vegetation cover and density of buildings in the surroundings of each nest. The results show that the number of nests with wire hangers and the percentage of the nest consisting of wire hangers were significantly greater in Osaka City than in Sakai City, but that the vegetation cover rate and buildings cover rate were significantly greater in Sakai City than in Osaka City. In Osaka City there was a significant negative rank correlation between the percentage of wire hangers and the vegetation cover rate and a significant positive rank correlation between the percentages of wire hangers and building cover rate, while in Sakai City there were no correlations. There was no significant difference between the two species. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that in Osaka City both crows tended to increase the percentages of wire hangers used in the nest in inverse proportion to the vegetation cover rate. But in Sakai City both crow species rarely used wire hangers even though the percentage of vegetation cover was less than 10% at which level crows in Osaka City mostly did use many wire hangers.

The St. Denis area had relatively more diverse land use and contained more wetlands than the Elstow area. Crows returned from winter ranges in early April and were frequently observed at breeding sites in late April, when nest building began. Overall, mean (.+-. SD) clutch initiation dates were 6 May (.+-. 6 days) at St. Denis and 10 May (.+-. 6) at Elstow, but, in 1988, clutches were initiated about 6 days earlier at St. Denis than at Elstow (P < 0.05). Density of nests at St. Denis averaged twice that found at Elstow (0.70 and 0.35/km2, respectively; P < 0.05). Size of incubated clutches did not differ between years or areas, and averaged 4.8 .+-. 0.6 eggs (n = 104). Hatching success did not differ by year or area, but in 1987, nests at St. Denis produced nearly twice as many young as at Elstow. Brood losses resulted from predation, starvation, and possibly other factors. Chicks in smaller broods gained mass faster and fledged at a lighter mass than chicks in larger broods. There were no consistent differences between areas in the mass, bill length, and head-bill lengths of 22-day-old chicks. Young fledged when they were between 30 and 34 days old. Crows at St. Denis had higher reproductive success (1987), nested at greater densities (1988 and both years combined), and began egg laying earlier (1988) than at Elstow, suggesting that St. Denis was a more productive breeding habitat.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,0,10,,,0008-4301,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01/01/1991,ZOOREC:ZOOR12800015660,

The frequency and the effects of the visits of 5 corvid species [Corvus frugilegus, Garrulus glandarius, C. monedula, Pica pica and C. corone] at magpie nests were compared. Magpies and crows were most often seen at the nests and preyed upon eggs and nestlings. The heavier and stronger crows were able to evict magpie pairs from their nests or nesting areas. The breeding success of pairs disturbed by other corvids was significantly lowered. Crow disturbance was reduced if magpies bred close to human dwellings and covered their nest with a roof. If eggs were presented in an experimental situation with an open and a domed nest, predation rate was higher in open nests. Predators, i.e., crows, jays and magpies, were identified by their bill-marks on plasticine eggs. The higher occurrence of open nests in areas far away from human dwellings coincides with a larger number of inexperienced birds breeding there.
